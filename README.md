When I go to the FIFO adoption agency site

* I see a description of the adoption process.
* I see a meaningful picture related to the description.
* I see a button for starting the adoption process.

When I visit the adoption page, I can see:

* An image of the pet;
* A physical description of the pet;
* The pet's name, gender, age, and breed.
* A story of the pet's journey to the shelter
